# PrototypeOS

### Contributors
Levi Hassel and Eugene Kuznetsov

## Overview
This is a prototype OS we designed for our Operating System Kernels class. It is divided into two separate projects:
* [Thread Scheduler](https://github.com/LeviHassel/PrototypeOS/tree/master/threadScheduler "Thread Scheduler") (Project 1)
* [Semaphore](https://github.com/LeviHassel/PrototypeOS/tree/master/semaphore "Semaphore") (Project 2), which builds upon the work of Project 1

## Requirements
In order to run this code, you need to have an Altera DE1/DE2 board handy.
