## Overview
This a prototype OS we designed for our Operating System Kernels class. It is divided into two separate projects: Thread Scheduler (Project 1) and Semaphore (Project 2), which builds upon the work of Project 1.

## Requirements
In order to run this code, you need to have an Altera DE2-115 board handy. If you actually have one, proceed into either project subdirectory and follow the directions in their READMEs.
